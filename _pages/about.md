"Anything one man can imagine, other men can make real." -Jules Verne

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. superivsed by [Prof. Olga Fink](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eAcIoUgAAAAJ&hl=en) at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Switzerland, and closely collaborating with Dr. Malcolm Mielle from Schindler. Before this, I completed my M.Sc. in Robotics at [Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/), Netherlands, and a B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering with distinction from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), China.

During my master's studies, I worked on robust dynamic visual SLAM systems and realistic dynamic environment simulations with [Prof. Aamir Ahmad](https://www.aamirahmad.de/) at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (MPI-IS)](https://is.mpg.de/), Tübingen, Germany. In my undergraduate years, I conducted research on passive assistive exoskeletons and developed a functional prototype with [Prof. Hongqiang Wang](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/wanghq/en/). I also collaborated with [Prof. Jianwen Luo](https://sites.google.com/view/jianwen-luo/home), focusing on the mechanical design of quadruped robots.

Inspired by the fantasies of Jules Verne and Isaac Asimov, I am captivated by the elegance of intelligent systems, which propels me to explore the intersections between the physical world and artificial intelligence. My current research interests lie in 3D vision and scene reconstruction, particularly in multimodal reconstruction for building assessment and renovation.
